        <p>We get it almost every night.
            When that moon is big and bright.
            It's a supernatural delight.
            Everybody's dancin' in the moonlight.
            Everybody here is out of sight.
            They don't bark, and they don't bite.
            They keep things loose, they keep 'em tight.
            Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight.
